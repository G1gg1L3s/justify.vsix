# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world's most popular markup languages.

Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn't like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

According to Gruber, Markdown syntax is designed to be readable and unobtrusive, so the text in Markdown files can be read even if it isn't rendered.

  > The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible.
  > The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

# Why Use Markdown?

- Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.
- Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. If you decide you don't like the Markdown application you're currently using, you can import your Markdown files into another Markdown application. That's in stark contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format.
- Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.
- Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you're using stops working at some point in the future, you'll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to books, university theses, and other milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.
- Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.

# How Does it Work?

Markdown applications use something called a Markdown processor (also commonly referred to as a "parser" or an "implementation") to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. At that point, your document can be viewed in a web browser or combined with a style sheet and printed. You can see a visual representation of this process below.

this is a four-part process:

1. Create a Markdown file using a text editor or a dedicated Markdown application. The file should have an .md or .markdown extension.
2. Open the Markdown file in a Markdown application.
3. Use the Markdown application to convert the Markdown file to an HTML document.
4. View the HTML file in a web browser or use the Markdown application to convert it to another file format, like PDF.

# Examples

You can easily create list and nested lists with markdown:

1. This is the first list item

    - It has a nested list inside and it has three items. You can also highlight text with **Bold** and *itali* here.
    - You can have as many nested lists, but it is recommended not go over three nested lists because it would become very unreadable, specially in small screens.
    - This is the third nested item.

2. This is the second list item.
3. THis is the third.
